I have been involved in a few digital projects that have given me a chance to take on the toughest challenge of all - achieving success in the open market.

[xLabs](/2013/07/xlabs-gaze/) is a partnership between myself, another business/IT specialist and two technical experts who have PhDs in robotics. This project excites us all because we all realise that there is incredible potential beyond today's fairly basic technology - human interaction.

[Linguaposta](/2012/08/online-retail-micro-business/) is an completely online retail venture. I leveraged my design skills and the language learning experience of myself and my partner to build a low maintenance, sustainable business with products that have a long shelf life.

[Chopsumi](/2012/02/project-social-voting-with-chopsumi/) was a collaboration between myself and two former colleagues. We were interested in the potential for creating really useful tools in a social context. Chopsumi was designed to help people to organise social events by streamlining the decisions of a social group.
