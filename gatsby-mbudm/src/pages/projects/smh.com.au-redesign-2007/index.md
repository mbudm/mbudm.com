The revamp of the smh.com.au was a task that the Fairfax Media Creative Services Unit was asked to undertake in mid 2007.I worked with the Head of Design on this project, conducting extensive research into advances in web typography that we could feasibly use on a page that gets 8 million page impressions every month.

Together we created a design that freed up the homepage, with less closed in boxes and more whitespace to let the reader flow effortlessly from one content area to another.

In online newspaper design you are very restricted in what you can achieve stylistically, so I am pleased to see that even as I write this in mid 2011 the 'bones' of our design remain strong despite the thousands of edits and minor updates that have taken place in that time.
