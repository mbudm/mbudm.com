Today my newest Flash file was released on [ActiveDen.net](http://activeden.net/item/mp3-music-player-with-artistalbum-library/63791?ref=mbudm "mp3 music player on ActiveDen"). It is an mp3 player with an attached album and artist library.

It is designed to be added to full flash web sites (like those built using my templates) and can handle a lot of music with an accordion style interface for collapsing and expanding artist and album sections of the library .
