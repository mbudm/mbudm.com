As a Senior Designer in the Creative Services Unit of Fairfax Media I was responsible for quite a few section redesigns of the main SMH & The Age 'broadsheet' newspaper web sites.

These sites are constantly changing with an average of 18 months between each redesign. In 2006/7 I worked on these sections:

*   BusinessDay section redesign
*   Entertainment (Including Ajax film ratings UI)
*   Digital life section
*   Life & Style section
*   FIFA world cup site 2006
