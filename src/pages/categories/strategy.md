title: Analysing what has happened and what the landscape shows then thinking ahead and contributing to plans for digital products.
---
From 2003-2006 I was responsible for the creation of an [eLearning Content Management System](/2006/06/elearning-content-management-system/) and in 2007-8 I was a [Product Manager](/tag/product-management/) at Fairfax Media. Both of these experiences provided me with insights and skills in business strategy. 

As a consultant and contributor I continue to write [business cases](/tag/business-case/), map out lightweight [digital marketing strategies](/tag/marketing/) and conduct [market](/tag/market-research/) and [user research](/tag/user-research/).
