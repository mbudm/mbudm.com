title: "As a consultant to small organisations and individuals I provide a low-cost, comprehensive digital service."
---

I achieve this by handling periodic maintenance and support, which provides me with a continual 'discovery' process that delivers insights into the issues and problems my clients face.

When an opportunity arises to do something more involved like a redesign or a new marketing campaign I am well placed to be a key contributor to my clients' project strategy.

Practically this means that one week I may demonstrate how to use WordPress to write effective and well designed text and images or I will create a plugin that provides a simple interface to enter content. The next week I could be writing a proposal on the best way to digitally engage donors in a 3 year, $20 million fundraising campaign.
