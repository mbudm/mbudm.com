title: Design is where my digital journey began, and I continue to be part of the design conversation
---
My early work in web production was primarily in [visual design](/tag/visual-design/). 

Later, as I have expanded my skillset I also took on [user experience design](/tag/user-experience-design/) roles that require [information architecture](/tag/information-architecture/) skills as well as [user research](/tag/user-research/) and [user testing](/tag/user-testing/)>.

More recently as a manager/lead in development teams I have worked with UX designers and Product people to shape the product direction we take.
