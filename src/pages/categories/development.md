title: Crafting an outcome with technology. Planning, design is great but actually seeing things 'come to life'... I never tire of that.
---
From around 2001 I have implemented most of the design work that I have created. My development experience originated in the front-end, [HTML](/tag/html/), [CSS](/tag/css/), [JavaScript](/tag/javascript/) (including  [ExtJS](/tag/extjs/) and [MxGraph](tag/mxgraph/) frameworks) and prior to its demise I created a lot of [ActionScript](/tag/actionscript/). I'm also a bit familiar with PHP and know my way around [WordPress](/tag/wordpress/), both plugins and themes. 
 
When working on development projects I have traversed the testing pyramid and integrated with [continuous integration](/tag/continuous-integration) (but sadly Continuous Deployment has been lacking in most workplaces). I've used [Git](/tag/html/) and [SVN](/tag/svn/) and other project tools like [BaseCamp](/tag/basecamp/), [Trello](/tag/trello/), [JIRA](/tag/jira/">) and [Confluence](/tag/confluence/).

More recently I've become more full stack as I have gotten familar with microservices, databases and using cloud providers like AWS. I have a particular interest in serverless architecture.
