At Xero we recently made an effort to get our development blog more active. I put my hand up a while ago to write about the practice I've been advocating for and demonstrating, using analytics more as a development team.

The article is now up:

- [The Butterfly Effect â€” or development by numbers](https://devblog.xero.com/the-butterfly-effect-or-development-by-numbers-fdbf41067781)

I'm pretty happy with it, and I've had great feedback from my colleagues and some interest from the wider community. 

It took me quite a while to write though so I'm not sure how prolifi I'll be. Maybe next time I'll try something that doesn't require me to be so careful about internal information. In this article a lot of work went into obfuscating competitor sensitive numbers while still making the examples tangible to the reader.
