	  <h2>What you can use Chopsumi to organise</h2>
	  <p>You can use Chopsumi to organise anything that involves people meeting at a place and time. We've purposely kept the design very open so that we can see what people do with Chopsumi.</p>
	  <p>Of course we have lots of ideas on what Chopsumi might be useful for:</p>
	  <ul class="minilist">
	  	<li>Catching up with old workmates at a pub</li>
	  	<li>Getting the extended family together for a picnic in a park</li>
	  	<li>Finding the right day and time for a mum's group to meet somewhere kid friendly</li>
	  	<li>Seeing busy friends at a restauarant in the city</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>All of these things have one thing in common, they a bunch of people who are time poor and have strong opinions wbout what they want to do and where. Simply picking a date and a place and sending out invitations can be very disheartening and frustrating when you are inundated with responses like "I'm busy next week, can we do it the week after?' or, I went to that bar  - it's terrible, can we meet somewhere better?'. It's a much better idea to get consensus with your friends and family first before deciding what you are going to do.</p>
	  <p>
	  </div>
	  
	  <a name="flowWhenWhere"></a>
	  <div class="cfix" id="flowWhenWhere">
	  <h2>What sort of date/time and location options you should add</h2>
	  <p>Pick the dates and times that suit the event you are trying to create, but be realistic about what your friends and family can do too. Even though Chopsumi lets your guests auggest more dates and locations, people are more likely to get excited about your event if the options you suggest suit them.</p>
	  <p> Creating an event using Chopsumi is like opening a conversation with your friends, you want to spark interest but you also want other people to contribute their ideas as well.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	  <a name="flowInvites"></a>
	  <div class="cfix" id="flowInvites">
	  <h2>There are multiple ways to invite your friends</h2>
	  <p>Currently you can invite friends via email or by Facebook.</p>
	  <p>You can type in as many email addressses as you like or you log in to your Google gmail account and select addresses from your contacts there.</p>
	  <p>More ways to invite friends to Chopsumi will be added when enough people ask for them - so <a href="/groupbuy/mobile/modal-feedback.html" class="modallink" title="Send feedback, suggestions and any issues to Chopsumi" >give us a shout</a> if you would like us to support something else.</p>

	  <a name="flowVoting"></a>
	  <div class="cfix" id="flowVoting">
	  <h2>Voting is easy and quick - Everyone <em>votes</em> on the options</h2>
	  <p>Voting on dates and locations involves clicking one of three buttons:</p>
	  <ul class="minilist">
	  	<li><strong>Yes</strong> for 'this date is great' or 'that bar rocks'</li>
	  	<li><strong>Maybe</strong> for 'I might be busy that day' or 'that place is ok but I prefer the other one'</li>
	  	<li><strong>No</strong> for 'that's my Mum's birthday - I can't make it' or 'that joint? Are you nuts?'</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>We kept it simple so that your friends can vote quickly and easily, but there is a bit of choice so that Chopsumi can accurately work out the best option for your event.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	  <a name="flowHowitworks"></a>
	  <div class="cfix" id="flowHowitworks">
	  <h2>How Chopsumi works out the best plan for you and your friends</h2>
	  <p>Chopsumi collates all the votes from your event and works out the favourite date and location for your event. This is a highly involved process that requires oodles of supercomputers accross the world all working in unison for a few milliseconds &mdash; it's our secret sauce.</p>
	  <p>Of course you can always ignore Chopsumi's hard work and decide for yourself which location or date is a better option for you and your friends. That's ok, Chopsumi doesn't bear any grudges, unlike other artificially intelligent entities that shall remain nameless but may have appeared in a late 60s sci-fi movie or a recently released 'smart' phone.</p>
	  </div>
	  
	  <a name="inviteEmail"></a>
	  <div class="cfix" id="inviteEmail">
	  <h2>What do friends that I invite via email see?</h2>
	  <p>Friends that you invite by email will get a message in their inbox that:</p>
	  <ul class="minilist">
	  	<li>Includes your event description</li>
	  	<li>Summarises the date and location options</li>
	  	<li>Contains a clear link asking them to RSVP and vote</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>When your friends click the link in the invite message, they will arrive at Chopsumi.com and follow the simple 3 step Invitation process that all invited guests complete.</p>
	  <ol>
	  	<li>RSVP to your event. If they RSVP 'no' then they skip the remaining steps. If they RSVP 'Yes' or 'Maybe' then they move on to the voting bit. They'll need to log in to Chopsumi with the password that we send to them.
	  	</li>
	  	<li>Vote on the locations that you have suggested. If they like (and if you have allowed it) they can suggest some more locations for everyone to vote on.
	  	</li>
	  	<li>Vote on the dates/times that you have suggested. As with locations, they can suggest more dates/imes for the group to vote on (if you allow this).
	  	</li>
	  </ol>
	  </div>
	
	  <a name="fbInviteProcess"></a>
	  <div class="cfix" id="fbInviteProcess">
	  <h2>What happens when I invite people via Facebook?</h2>
	  <p>When you invite people via Facebook they receive a 'notification' saying that you have invited them to your event. When your friend clicks on this notification they are taken to the Chopsumi Facebook Application where they are asked for permission to add Chopsumi to their Facebook account. This is a pretty common step that you and your friends have probably completed yourself many times on Facebook.</p>
	  <p>Once your friend has added Chopsumi to their account they will follow the simple 3 step Invitation process that all guests complete.</p>
	  <ol>
	  	<li>RSVP to your event. If they RSVP 'no' then they skip the remaining steps. If they RSVP 'Yes' or 'Maybe' then they move on to the voting bit. 
	  	</li>
	  	<li>Vote on the locations that you have suggested. If they like (and if you have allowed it) they can suggest some more locations for everyone to vote on.
	  	</li>
	  	<li>Vote on the dates/times that you have suggested. As with locations, they can suggest more dates/imes for the group to vote on (if you allow this).
	  	</li>
