		<description><![CDATA[Hi Paul, Yep you&#039;re right. I did a quick bit of research. As I understand it now the keyword internal is like private but for the entire package, not just the individual class. So that would make it usable in the above example as extended classes are in the same package.

Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[your situation (and mine as ov 5 minutes ago) can be solved by swapping &quot;private&quot; for &quot;internal&quot;. I&#039;ve had errors with private functions, which won&#039;t compile when I&#039;m trying to do simple overrides, and say for example inheriting a variable. A bunch of examples I had a while back from a cookbook kept using internal.  I&#039;m no oop guru, I&#039;m still trying to get to grips with the whole thing, so i don&#039;t know why private fails and internal works or what their difference is]]></description>
