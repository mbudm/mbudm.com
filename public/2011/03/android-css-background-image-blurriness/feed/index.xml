for these wonderful words. It is a well known &#039;key&#039; that 
what prompted many political leaders to first strive for power was gamecube emulator

The concern which we must each ask ourselves is,
will we allow gamecube emulator for android to gain our ballot?

Verdict

To repeat, gamecube emulator for android must not 
be allowed to obtain in the way of the bigger inquiry: why are we below?

Putting this apart its of terrific relevance.
It inspires, makes sure monetary stability and it brings the most effective out in individuals.


The final say goes to the award winning Elvis Hanks:

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m having an issue with using a 1x30px gradient image that tiles horizontally for a menu button. The problem is, on my android device, when the button is taller than 30px the tile should blend to a solid color but it appears that the gradient image is being repeated vertically by 1px causing a 1px line to appear. The strange thing is that it appears on some buttons but not on others even though they are all the same height. Could this be an issue with compression or something all together different. Any help would be appreciated as googling is not finding me any answers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Richard, yes I guess it is actually a feature... or at least a limitation of the environment. The problem for me was that it proved very hard to discover what the problem was in the android documentation.

This of course was mostly because of the impossibility of getting accurate search results using keywords like &#039;CSS android bug big sprite images&#039; - I can&#039;t remember all the combos I used but basically the resulted in a lot of CSS 101 type blog posts ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if technically this is a bug, or rather an optimisation that produces some unexpected results.

An uncompressed image needs four bytes of data per pixel (even for relatively &#039;boring&#039; areas of the image) so your 73kb image actually needs 2.7Mb in memory. Android is just trying to save some of its RAM for other tasks.

I guess this behaviour might change in the future as we get a) more powerful phones, and b) specialised algorithms that might only need to decompress portions of the image in order to render them.

In any case, a useful post and good analysis of the issue so thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree 100% with Jim, THANKS!

The bug seems to be fixed recently somewhere though. I upgraded my HTC Desire HD to Android 2.3.3 this week and it rendered the sprite just fine, as where the Android SDK emulator for 2.3 stil contained this bug.]]></description>
